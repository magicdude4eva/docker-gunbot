- @Ahpigsy commits:
- ðŸ“¢ Introducing Candle Analysis Tournament Edition v1.81
  - Weâ€™re pleased to share a new version of our trading strategy.
  - ðŸ”‘ In This Update:
  - Introduced caching for expectedMovePercent, profitTarget, and minimumSellLevel in stratStore, allowing the strategy to reuse previous calculations instead of recomputing them unnecessarily.
  - Added a 50% discrepancy threshold: If the new expectedMovePercent or profitTarget differs by more than 50% from the cached value, it reverts to the previous stable value to prevent erratic adjustments.
  - minimumSellLevel is recalculated based on the effective profit target and average buy price (ABP), with the same stability check applied.
  - Detailed logging (e.g., "Cached values updated - Expected Move % Range: 6.74, ...") helps track when and why recalculations occur.
  - check that lastBuyTime is being reset after a sell, triggering the timeSinceLastBuy cooldown.
  - ensured the MAX_BASE_FUND_LIMIT check applies globally to all buy attempts (regular and BUY_ON_ENTRY)
  - Other logging changes and updating of some other Panel Messages to be more concise
  - Reset cycle activated on config change, recalculating Profit Target and Expected Move % values
  - We hope the Candle Analysis Tournament Edition v1.81 provides a helpful tool for your trading journey.
